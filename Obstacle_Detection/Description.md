# Dazzla - Obstacle detection Part

The provided Python script implements real-time object detection using a pre-trained model, assisting visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles in their environment. Here's a description of the project:

## Overview

The obstacle detection system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and classify objects in the environment, providing auditory feedback to visually impaired individuals.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes a pre-trained object detection model to identify obstacles in the user's surroundings in real-time.
- **Auditory Feedback**: Provides spoken feedback to the user about the detected objects, enabling them to navigate safely.
- **Multiple Object Detection**: Capable of detecting and classifying various objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, furniture, and more.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Offers an interactive interface with voice commands and audible alerts for seamless user interaction.

## Dependencies

- OpenVINO Toolkit
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- IPython
- Pyttsx3
